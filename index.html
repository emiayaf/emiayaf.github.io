    <h2>About</h2>

    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>Soprano Emily Finke has been praised for her “rich color palette” and “deft high range.” (South Florida Classical Review) Originally from Los Altos, California, Finke has performed the roles of Geraldine from Barber’s A Hand of Bridge and Noelle from Leanna Kirchoff’s Scrapbookers with Frost Opera Theater. She has also performed scenes as Tytania from Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Tina from Dove’s Flight, and Gretel from Humperdinck’s Hänsel und Gretel. In 2021, Finke was a featured soloist in excerpts of John Adams’ El Niño with Frost Opera Theater. In 2022, Fine will sing the role of Sally in Joe Illick’s children’s opera, Stone Soup as part of Florida Grand Opera Outreach. Finke studies with Robynne Redmon at the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami and will graduate with a BM in vocal performance in May 2022.</p>

    <h3>New Music</h3>
    <p>I find new music immensely exciting because of the increased diversity in music and styles of storytelling that I have the opportunity to tell through it. My love of new music has also increased my appreciation for the traditional cannon and the roots of the operatic art form. It is a goal of mine to collaborate with composers, librettists, directors, set designers, costume designers, other singers, and so many more creative professionals to put on exciting shows that explore both existing traditions and new ideas. I want to be part of a generation that both respects and advances the operatic art form through innovation.</p>
